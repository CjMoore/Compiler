# Compiler

This project was undertaken by myself and my programming mentor. The goal was to explore how compilers work. It is built in ruby and leverages the [combinator pattern](https://wiki.haskell.org/Combinator_pattern). Here is a [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j2eUJa61tC7gqfCrutDA7Hz0HFVJ67ha_0nodWjtJdU/edit?usp=sharing) to a presentation I wrote on this project.
